@freaK_09,"What slows down the cars behind is the hot and dirty air that's coming from the car in front that gets in the bottom of the car that's behind and makes its downforce way worse, because the air has heat and the hot air expands. Making the car that's behind slower and unable to overtake, that's why DRS (Drag Reduction System) exists. And drivers can enable it only when they are less than one second from the car in front and in specific DRS zones. You should correct that.",2

@NiltonMeira,"Being an F1 specter for about 30 years now, staying up late and waking up early on Sundays to see the spectacular Airton Senna, I can safely say that you nailed a very light, yet deep enough explanation for someone that doesn't know F1 to get a good glimps of it. As always another great video.",2

@andrewdakus1766,"The practice session was not ""interrupted""... I paid $500 to be there and they made MILLIONS off of Thursday ticket sales and they built a shabby track and kicked out all the fans and then ran the practice in private.  It was closer to the world's biggest robbery than an interruption",2
@raulmedina2024,NO,2
@redsoxboi1,Thank God Lewis is leaving Mercedes. Toto and the team giving him 0 chances.,2
@andreagv3,"Ha ha, it's so endearing to see Americans get all excited about this ""brand new"" sport, that they now make all these explainer videos, as if nobody knows anything about it, and they now ""discovered"" this sport and want to explain it to everyone else....Dudes, it's been 70+ years that it's existed, and we have been avidly following since the 50's.... Brits, Italians, Germans, French, S. Americans, we've always been big fans...Kinda shows how oblivious Americans are outside of their own bubble to what is actually happening in the world...So welcome to F1, but it's not a ""new"" sport... you're just late to the game! LOL!",2

@shannonmcstormy5021,"I stopped watching when F1 Race Direction stole Hamilton's championship and gave it to the cheaters: Red Bull. Good sportsmanship is critical to my enjoyment of a given sport. F1 pooped the bed there and have done nothing to reclaim my loyalty since. The ""recent"" manhole cover incident where the victim of the race track, Carlos Sainz, was penalized?! was but another ridiculous and patently-unfair rulings.",2

@EmmanuelChegeni,"For the first time, someone has made F1 make sense to me, always wondered why they had such huge budgets and what all the hype was about, now i understand, i think watching it as a tech competition and art makes much more sense than watching it as simply a race.",2
