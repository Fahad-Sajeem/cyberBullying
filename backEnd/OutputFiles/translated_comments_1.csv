@karthikkarunakaranmenon6785,Suspension harshness is an issue 😢
@QuaProsTer,"Dear Strell<br><br>Kindly add the clutch feel in all of your bike reviews. Because it is very important in the city usage (especially in Bangalore, I hope you know well 😜).  And also add the mudguard functionality.<br><br>Thank you"
@jamshick2944,I didn&#39;t like it..I ran away
@paulbarber6071,"Booked this last day! Waiting for the bike into the hands! <br>Test driven the bike , it’s nice! <br>Switching from a standard 350 2018 to this! <br>Main concerns was safety and comfort while the long drives! <br>Done many long drives with the RE but still the safety features are lacking! With a pillion more pressure on the same! <br>Was looking forward to upgrade to a adv tourer and ended up with this! <br>Yezdi himalayan dominar and long list which was made and took the test drives! <br>But this machine stole my heart ! <br>Especially after all positive feedback’s, the looks in the road🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥<br>People has already seen and there is nothing new in the looks of the other listed bikes! <br>But this one is a head turner !!🔥🔥🔥🔥<br>This will take the attention of a petrol head a bit while it’s in the road!  <br>I was addicted and waiting now for the same to be in hands 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"

@WizardOzTheGreat,"You must add an English translation below those Malayalam texts in your video. Hope your videos are not restricted to only those who read Malayalam. If so, you can mention it in your video title, and people like me can skip it instead of watching it."

@charlyjohn9957,I have a FZX i am thinking of upgrading to V storm 250 ... Just wanted to know if the suspension is harder than FZX
@sonudascc3847,This is for touring for Indian roads .and power delivery is fairly naked as Gixxer also the suspension.and for India this is needed.if you need more power we need more good roads and good traffic.hence suzuki is good in all ways compared to whole other brands.
@riazmajid024,Yamaha fz25 engine is way better than this machine
