@JayantRaut,Laws of physics must be followed üòÆüòÆ,2
@nicoheidenreich,Why bother with air filled tires if there are no rules? Why not rigid wheels/tires and just add more suspension? There could still be mechanical compliance in a semi rigid wheel. Or would the rubber coating just be ripped off any version of solid wheels?,2
@malcolm_in_the_middle,"Why must there be 4 wheels? That seems like an unnecessary limitation. Three-wheeled cars would be substantially lighter, and may be possible without introducing additional stability issues.",2
@FirstClass-,That hairdo could use some rules as well‚Ä¶.,2
@Xorthis,"No mention of one of the largest restrictions that limits these cars: Driver safety. The halo in F1 is one of the most obvious safety features that can be dumped, but then things like helmets can also be dropped for weight reasons. I wonder how this affects the shape of the car, now we don't care about protective monoshells etc.",2
@ProxyGamingPG,well that was a pointless video,2
@dmitrii_cl,"No rules? Ok, just add one machine gun üòÇ",2
@jackhuffman9313,"Haha, that would be Jim hall a great Texas car constructor with a farmers research and development approach",2
@dlyon9673,I regularly pull 0.23 g's in my 2013 Honda Fit.  Which I actually love driving.,2
@cardboardboification,"Their should be a open F1 class just like in every other racing,  Maybe just limit the CI of the Engines",2
@j7ndominica051,"Current F1 cars look boring, all the same shape only different colors.",2
@buggerlugz6753,If there were no rules it'd be worth watching!,2
@vincentstruxiano7109,"And if there are no rules, how about genetics¬†? Take some DNA from Fangio, Clark, Prost, Mansell, Senna, add a little bit of Ryan Gosling or Scarlett Johansson because you wanna make it sexy too, you now have the perfect driver... and you can tell him/her to stay away from the car, because no matter what they do, a computer will always be lighter and faster.",2
@SonicBoone56,Deliciously complicated - Willem Toet,2
@ninab.4540,"I mean, remove the driver in the car, apply vr in the driver, they drive daytona 93 style, and the driverless cars are on a real track. Boom, pretty rockets.",2
@bookworm8415,So. What if the driver were in a more prone position and the seat rotates into the curve to make the G forces more lateral. Basically a 4 wheeled motorcycle in concept?,2
@parizzi,even the expert's hair is aerodinamyc O_o,2
@xemorider2853,When the specialist said fans and nodded so enthusiastically i was like yeah! He remembers the fan cars fondly,2
@Danuxsy,If it had no rules you would remove the person and have it being driven by a neural net,2
@ImInLoveWithBulla,3:10 exactly what specific acceleration record was that? Cuz I‚Äôve seen top fuel drag cars. And that ain‚Äôt one.,2
@DefyMaxing,srt tomahawk happens,2
@darchandarchan7036,the best thing i learned from this video is that we sneeze up to 2.9G,2
@peterobinson3678,The 114th   funniest video i haz ever seen is Tom Scott hitting 100kph in under 1.5 seconds...  Because Tom Scott was apparently unaware that Cats are a thing.,2
@qazqazqazqaz100,if it has no rules mount guns on the car and turn it into twisted mettle.,2
@libordrozdek3307,If there were no rules then I would expect some cannon on top of that to eliminate opponents :D,2
@aidanlswadling2481,you shouldve looked at the possibility of a nitromethane fuel and engine adapted to that,2
@pjofurey6239,"It might be interesting or even exciting again , the succession of radio controlled dullards and suckholes today are not interesting enough to compare to the days of the Cossie v8,s ,turbos and parties",2
@matuopm,I'd love a competition like that. Just some Basic rules like:4 wheels. maybe some size and weight target. some on board cameras. and the rest is free to design. that would be amazing.,2
@piranha_gaming7154,So if we go with no rules then we should be able to build a starting contraption around the car right? So how about we just build a rail gun and shoot the car out of that?,2
@averitiamiku,1:11 so your saying he's the head of aerodynamics while his haircut is creating a lot of drag and air resistance?,2
@aimanhakim3304,Soo... just a giant size tamiya?,2
@averitiamiku,Redbull scientists waking up everyday with air drag ready to fight the laws of physics to eat breakfast and then try to gain as much downforce in their cube like cars to then work on a car that abuses the air,2
@GamersOdyssey,"The hell is a mile per hour learn to use metric, lost interest...",2
@abufidaluqmanhakim8585,"No rules Cars looks like Cars in Cyber formula anime,  my guess",2
@user-ch8th6vs5h,"There's needs to be a no formula ""formula"" racing that's what ppl want .. it will get more viewers than f1 I promis3",2
@user-fy9cl4fk7e,MPH? How many beans per frogs is this?,2
@Ranjeetkumarspoems,I thought you were goin to show a model or something.,2
@Paldasan,Randall Monroe (XKCD) did a thought experiment on this in his What If? series.,2
@incognito8448,1986 F1 1000 horsepower you could feel the rumble in the next county,2
@playgamessimulatior,cyber Formula?,2
@verbat1900,"F1 should be remote controlled so there is no driver, then see what they can really do.",2
@madbrute6204,Add ejection seat or a ejection cockpit,2
@quantumenergysolutions9128,"Dont forget Tubercalls for the leading edge, Shark skin for body. And Owl wing for trailing edges.",2
@veryty5251,@Redbull why not making it?,2
@yusticiano,"I like the video materials but i hit dislike button because you are still using ancient greek measurement unit which am a modern man doesnt know, mph?!? What is that?!? I bet you are still using sundial at home instead clock.",2
@GRUMPYS_GARAGE,"Driver and 4 Wheels should be the ONLY ""rules"".If one team develops something that allows them to dominate.. that is a GOOD thing because you know the very next year every other team will have developed their own version of whatever it is.. and the technology will increase by leaps and bounds!That technology will then be assimilated by the private market and everyone will benefit from it in the end.",2
@bobby3849,Many thanks üåπüôè‚ù§Ô∏è,2
@jfbaro2,Would a pilot be as safe in an accident as a normal F1 car?,2
@EnjoyCocaColaLight,I'm confused as to what rules are being broken here... it sounds like they're just making better F1 cars?,2
@timschultz7755,Has anyone or team used ionizers at strategic points on the car to improve aerodynamics?,2
@marcusrussell8660,"I would love to see this, but with all the safety equipment.",2
@samaxe6495,"If there were no rules, then sets rules. üòÇ",2
@ArturHg90,Is same can-am which make now ATV? :D,2
@prohling,We hate electric,2
@thinkforyourself4046,I would give it water drop shape,2
@atomicskull6405,There is clearly a market for a circuit version of Pike's Peak and I have no idea why it hasn't happened yet.,2
@atomicskull6405,"""What if Formula 1 had no rules?"" It would be *ucking awesome is what.",2
@user-pc2hf4ek7u,The fia is Killing all inovations,1
@fibram1008,"Fascinating. With superfast cars, the human being is going to be the weak point",2
@weedo4269,At that point just engeneer a car with bigger wings and that hovers over ground to reduce pressure on tiresüòÇüòÇ,2
@user-qb1sm3rk9r,If Formula 1 had no rules it would be like the average day on  Russian roads.,2
@dennishonecker5960,"I rember this  racing car in a Comic from Zack introducing Michel Vaillant (or so) Ground effecf was clearly explained. A good comic for kids. I guess it's not available anymore,since this story was from around 1973",2
@observingrogue7652,"My favorite hypothetical prototype car, is the SRT Tomahawk X.That is the first car that comes to mind, that would need a fighter pilot suit just to survive it.We can also say F tires, and go the route of F-Zero X & GX, and the Redout games.",2
@3D_Printing,Slap a Rocket onto a Maglev car... that should help :),2
@tindekappa9047,Honestly there's no reason for the drivers to be in the car in 2024. They could pilot them remotely like a drone and the cars could be outrageous death traps with a potato sack on the driver seat to account for driver weight.,2
@donaldburkhard7932,Don‚Äôt know if you still read after month. But what if move radiator under car and use fan in conjunction with it?,2
@Gustavo-go8tj,seria formula 0,2
@Ardeact,4:15 The size of that spoiler is ricer level,2
@firmbutton6485,Why do we need a driver?,2
@maynore9049,"What do you mean with ""The laws of physics must be followed."" ? It's not possible to not follow the laws of physics.",2
@keshmulasoks5714,What if u could find away to be able to change the rubber whiles the car is moving!! I think ü§î it's possible!,2
@EarendilStar,The G force of a sneeze really helps me forgive my nearly 40yo body for pulling a muscle in my back during my last cold.,2
@TheKingsapostle,This video is way too long.,2
@simonvazquez6751,"All tech things considered, would there be a point where the limiting factor would be the track surface, i.e. would a car with so much downforce and grip literally pull up the surface ?",2
@kenton6098,"Well, the head of exterior design has a pretty good point!",2
@ursklauser4330,If I am a designer or part of the design team I would ask to investigate the use of air sausages with scidd plates to stop wear. They would adjust but always seal to eagres air,2
@joshuahansen5486,When it comes to the question of the tires you're right modern tires kind of suck so you would want a dual system like a semi to increase safety and surface area and having more than just four tires would be a great idea think 8 plus,2
@joshuahansen5486,When it comes to fans you're thinking too small you should have actual propellers that can be pointed towards the ground or a rear word for more thrust and of course replacing the engine with a jet engine would probably work pretty well too,2
@joshuahansen5486,When it comes to the braking system it would be more intelligent to use an electric motor and capacitor system you have the energy going into a capacitor which can then be reapplied to the motor after it gets out of the turn,2
@barrypickles6546,What about the engine size? 4wd?,2
@wilgarcia1,I bet you can make skirts that slide on the ground like skis and sit in a slot in the car. Still not perfect but much better seal.,2
@wilgarcia1,the Tire doesn't have to take that much G forces if the car weighs less =),2
@mgtworld,thats not even the fastest car in granturismo....,2
@BerserkBrownie,we would then have batmobiles,2
@ovvuhysk5472,Group B : Rule 1) vehicle,2
@MrJule04,There is a project called ¬´¬†LePinacle by Lamour¬†¬ª on internet which is to create a F1 car with same rules ! Great video ! Loved it !,2
@anthonysach-htec5934,Laying down head forward to drive could help with the lateral G forces and the car body could be made with a lower profile. Maybe at a 20 to 30 degree angle so you can see over the front suspension.Not far off the angle of laying on a motorcycle tank to get your head below the screen..,2
@anthonysach-htec5934,"You say at the beginning the car must have 4 wheels,  the rules in the mid 70s allowed the Tyrrell P34 to have 6 wheels.The quickest way to make a shopping list of what you want for a no rules car is to start with what has been banned in the past.",2
@spudbencer7179,"that's a whole lot of video for ""I don't know"" and I didn't watch any of it, glad I didn't.",2
@chaostade4087,this is so exciting to think about.,2
@dallasbrown-ew8yk,"In concept these ideas are cool, but the race series that should exist is an endurance series with manufacturers racing street legal cars with no mods that customers can‚Äôt get from the factory. The classes should be based on price.",2
@goltzhar,No rules = Dead drivers,2
@andyfry745,It would be 99.5% more watchable,2
@Finicky9,"Why does it have to have a driver, I want an rc f1 car",2
@timsmith5449,there never used to be a 4 wheel rule either,2
@phamchithien,"there is an anime in the 80s for this exact topic ... its called cyber formula gpx, active aero and suspension , even jet boost and AI assist and such .... it was wild",2
@JoseMiguelSantosPT,Mr. Just love your YouTube channel. Great content. Congratulations.,2
@brianrasmussen2956,"In the words of Alonso:""We put Rocketship!""",2
@teamgonzo9289,It would be much faster.Why is it the first thing you want to do is start laying down rules!??,2
@soysaucefeng4430,No rules?  No driver. Ai will do better.,2
