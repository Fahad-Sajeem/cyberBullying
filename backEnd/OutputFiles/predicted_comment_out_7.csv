@paulbarber6071,"Booked this last day! Waiting for the bike into the hands! Test driven the bike , it’s nice! Switching from a standard 350 2018 to this! Main concerns was safety and comfort while the long drives! Done many long drives with the RE but still the safety features are lacking! With a pillion more pressure on the same! Was looking forward to upgrade to a adv tourer and ended up with this! Yezdi himalayan dominar and long list which was made and took the test drives! But this machine stole my heart ! Especially after all positive feedback’s, the looks in the road🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥People has already seen and there is nothing new in the looks of the other listed bikes! But this one is a head turner !!🔥🔥🔥🔥This will take the attention of a petrol head a bit while it’s in the road!  I was addicted and waiting now for the same to be in hands 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥",2
