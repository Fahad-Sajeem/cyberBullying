@Ajentertainment90,Manjummal Bais has shown Tamil police very badly.. Just watch Ithum angane..<br> (Those who say it happened must prove it did not happen.)
@SankarGS,"Mair is this the song when the hero first looks at the heroine 😆🔥Hmm, even worse than this, he is better looking at the Tamil girl 😸😸"
@PriyeshK-hu4wl,Last Mamukoya 😂😂😂😂
@Omanaunni,"Mamata Baiju, who went to spoil the Malayalees for money and relevance, if you say that she should be called Cheta&#39;s mole, she should not be allowed to set foot in Kerala. Similarly, if a Tamil actress had been shown, Tamilians would have rejected her."
@user-nq6re3lg5y,"Malayalee female directors make Tamils happy (Manjummal Boys) When trying to earn money, Tamil actors put us in a circle.. This is the picture.. Malayalee boys and girls are bad."
@vishnumr8014,"The queens of Kerala are interested in the pandis, no matter how much the pandis insult the Malayalis, the Malayalee Poomaks who support them 😡"

@anuvardhank.n3337,Kudos to the actors and dialogue writers who worked on Malayalam parts in this film.
@UNNI-uv2mm,Tamilians are total aphrodisiacs and will act with great respect and malice on the outside ❗️<br> There is a lot of malice in inviting Malayali girls from Kerala<br> -by an experienced person

@VigneshVignesh-vg6kh,The claim of Malayalis that all Tamil Nadu men fall in love with Kerala girls is wrong. Women. They are beautiful. Why should we say we want a Kerala girl when there are crores of Tamil girls in Tamil Nadu?
@veenaveena5841,"After the Kerala story, the next one has come<br> And since Malayalees have information, we are not spreading any immadiri aravatas"
