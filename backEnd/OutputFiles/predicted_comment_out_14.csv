I like your videos a lot, very explanatory!I also watched the series of Corey Shafer on Flask (which I liked BTW), but yours are more instructive and clearer so far. You use less additional libraries, which let it be more Pythonic.",2

I started falling behind when we were expecting to see Chrome console output... I don't see any. I also don't see the ""print(req)"" output in the flask console either... I've been through the code line-by-line from pythonise.com too...  I've spotted the obvious ""submit_message()"" and ""submit_entry()"" function name differences... odd",2
