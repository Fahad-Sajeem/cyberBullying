@kobvel,What about the data privacy? Where does your document go?,2
@micalbozz156,"Unfortunately doesn´t work for me. It always responds with ""Hmm, I´m not sure"".",1
@senorchavo5572,I need troubleshooting assistance.  I csn get everything connected...independently openai will respond.

@jamminrebel3614,This 👏 is 👏 freaking 👏 awesome. 👏love you.,2
@marcuskirsch4128,You know your stuff. But  I am struggling to follow this to replicate its a lot of detail.,2
@MattGadi,"Hi, many thanks for the video. How did you prepare the txt input file? Do you have a video or link to understand the contend and how to prepare it?Thanks",2
@xugefu,Thanks!,2
@sanderschat,"funny to read all them comments from 'non-coders', thinking they too finally can add cool chatbots to websites for their clients... sure...It is the same like AI is producing some crappy music, and then they say 'Ah, me as a non-musician can finnaly create music and sell it to the world'... sure....",1
@mohsenghafari7652,hi. please help me. how to create custom model from many pdfs in Persian language? tank you.,2
@safetime100,Thanks ❤,2
@texsearch,10 minutes if you have quite a bit of experience and already have accounts set up.  Definitely not 10 minutes for a newb.,2
@iGuide_net,How much do you have to pay per search to the GPT provider? One metric i saw had chatgpt-4 at 30 cents per search.,2
@josh-cc9oy,"i want to give one like 3000 academic papers and make it able to be queried, is that too big?",2
@gabriel-gr,"Very cool, thanks! I tried to do the same with some (large-ish) PDF's but I'm getting `InsufficientQuotaError: 429` from OpenAI ;-(",2
@thejordankeyes,This is pretty cool. How could we use this to chat with whole databases full of records instead of just a single file at a time?,2
@nilsbuer,Very cool video. Content and video quality,2
@lancerkind,"Copy/pasting the ""connect credential""s is different now than how the video shows. In the Flowise UI, you can no longer copy/paste the credentials. You need to click on the Connect Credential field and select ""create new"" which opens a popup window. In that window, put in your username and then finally you can copy/paste the API key.",2
@Sergio-rq2mm,"Having watched your other videos, I was hoping that you might revisit this topic using the facebook vector tool and PGvector. Is that something you might considering?",2
@GigaChadL337,Let third party handle your company's data other than google aws or MS? No thanks,2
@emanuelecorbellini5110,"How big of a document could I use here to then ask questions? For example, could I take real json formatted event data from a videogame with 100k maus and then ask the bot ""What's the retention?"" Or ask it ""what are the most used units in the game?""",2
@Ricocase,Is it private?  Langchain isn't private.,2
@AbdelrahmanEmad-mm2xs,"thanks for this great tutorial, am frontend developer so how can i build SAAS on this?",2

@officialp283,😊,2
@dozieweon,Nob question: How is this different from building it on Botpress?,2

@marcello9628,"Amazing! I added the pdf file, asked the bot ""what's the doc about?""and its answer was... ""I dont know""... i sh#t you not. We went around in circle like that.. my favorite part? Ï added 2 documents to the flow""- his answer ""based on the given context it is not specified how many documents the person added to the flow"" like wtf",2
@stephensuprios1896,Nice and extremely useful video Dave… how can I use a website as the source? This allows for updates to immediately be available and we don’t have multiple locations of our data items.,2

@JakubSK,"Using OpenAI is cheating. Now use your own model, and train it yourself, then serve it up yourself for inference. Go.",2
@mrdman094081,"Liked, Sub'd. 👏👍😁",2
@mrdman094081,After watching several times it looks like I might need to be a developer or software writer to complete this.  Are any others in this thread totally new to A.I. and have made a complete chat bot ?  Does The material loaded become public ?,2
@Syedhussainipage,Thank you for this amazing video. Would you be kind to build an app that would refer to a given website and reply based on that site's data?,2

@nickrobinson7096,"How does it deal with the structure of a PDF? For example, if I have a Table with CAS numbers in the format 1234-56-7. Usually, I can use Regex to extract these patterns however what if the text is contained in a table column and broken by a carriage return or just generally by the structure of the document?  e.g. 123-45-6In a single column. It seems that the text file generated will not keep this text together. This is a frequent issue I run into when extracting data.",2
@gr8tbigtreehugger,Very cool! Many thanks!,2

I was able to create the GitHub account, I have the API keys for CHAT and Pinecode.. But then it's too much for an ignorant like myself. I would love to have a tutorial like this but step by step like I'm 5! LOL Thank's anyway!",2

@somethingmystical567,it keeps saying this for me: * error decoding 'ports': No port specified: : how do i fix that?,2
@f1l4nn1m,"Hi Dave, thanks for sharing. Flowise is pretty cool as a rapid-prototyping tool, you can visually chain complex objects in just a matter of minutes. I found some cons though, which I think the devs should address.  - Debugging is tough. Each API-based component should have a test button (does the key work? is the deployment name correct?). Those aren't things you want to guess from pieces of text in the chat box. - Coding. It's nice to have a visual interface, but at the end of the day this is just chaining function calls. It would be nice to have the Python code corresponding to a specific saved flow. So that one can customize it.I wonder if they are interested in getting precise feedback from users to improve and prioritize features. I'd be really kin to help them build a great product.",2

@PointlessPOS,And document readers that read YouTube video?,2
@user-zt2dj4rl6d,An addition to the setup if (a) you are running on Apple silicon (i.e. M1 or M2) and (b) you want to use Docker compose.When I first went to the docker setup and issued the command   $ docker-compose up -dIt the docker container for flowise failed to start because the platform was not specified.The solution is to add the platform specification line to `docker-compose.yml` immediately after the line `image: flowiseai/flowise`My file now looks like this:```version: '3.1'services:    flowise:        image: flowiseai/flowise        platform: linux/amd64…```,2
